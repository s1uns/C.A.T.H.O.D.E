## Junior Academy of Sciences Project

### Overview
This project, developed in 2020, was one of my first endeavors in the realm of game development. It was presented at the Junior Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and was recognized with an award. It involved the implementation of a web-based application using basic HTML, JavaScript, and the Phaser.js framework.


### Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web pages and defining their content.
- **JavaScript**: Employed for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the application.
- **Phaser.js**: Utilized as a Canvas and WebGL 2D game framework for creating immersive gaming experiences within the project.

### Project Description
This project is a doodle-jump alike game set in a futuristic world where players control a robot navigating platforms suspended in the sky. The main objective is to guide the robot upwards by jumping from one platform to another, collecting coins and batteries along the way to improve the robot's score and acquire extra lives. However, players must be cautious of radiation tokens scattered throughout the levels, as collision with them results in the loss of a life. The game features dynamic platform generation, ensuring that each playthrough offers a unique experience. With vibrant graphics and engaging gameplay mechanics, this project provides an exciting and challenging gaming experience for players of all ages.
